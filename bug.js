This bug is related to using Tailwind directives in JavaScript template literals. The issue arises when trying to dynamically generate class names using Tailwind's utility classes within a JavaScript template literal.  The problem is that the string interpolation within the template literal may not correctly interpret Tailwind's classes, leading to unexpected behavior or rendering issues. For example, if you are trying to dynamically add classes based on a variable's value, you might find that the classes are not applied correctly. Consider this example:

```javascript
const dynamicClass = 'bg-red-500';
const element = `<div class='${dynamicClass}'>This is a test</div>`;
```

In this scenario, the `bg-red-500` class might not be applied correctly, and the div might not appear with a red background. This is because the template literal's string interpolation might not recognize or correctly parse Tailwind's class names. This can be particularly problematic when dealing with more complex class names or when using other Tailwind directives within the template literal.
