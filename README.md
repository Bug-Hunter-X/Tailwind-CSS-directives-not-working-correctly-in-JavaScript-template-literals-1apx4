# Tailwind CSS Directives in JavaScript Template Literals Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug related to using Tailwind CSS directives within JavaScript template literals. The issue arises when dynamically generating class names using Tailwind's utility classes inside a template literal. The string interpolation might not correctly parse Tailwind's classes, causing unexpected rendering behavior.

## Bug Description

When dynamically adding Tailwind classes to elements using template literals, the classes may not be applied correctly. This leads to incorrect styling and visual discrepancies.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy implementation.
3. Run the JavaScript code to see the incorrect rendering.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` for the corrected implementation.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind's class names are correctly processed during string interpolation. This can often be achieved by using a different approach to dynamically generating classes, such as using an object to store classes, or separating the Tailwind classes from the string template.
